This app was made as part of the beginners/intermediate Scrimba React course. The app is a travel journal blog app where several travels destinations are shown. A photo, the google maps location link, the date(s) visited, and a description of the place are given. 

The goals of the app were to:

(1) get familiar with React concepts like passing and destructuring props, children, and reusable components, as well as mapping over data and creating React elements
(2) practice implementing SCSS styling based on Figma designs 
(3) get familiar with continous deployment on Netlify through Github.

The deployed end product can be viewed at:
